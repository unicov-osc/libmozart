/**
 * The Mozart++ String formatter placeholders.
 * <p>
 * The structure of the placeholder are described as:
 * {<floating-points><output-format><alignment>}
 * where:
 *
 * <p>
 * <floating-points> must start with a dot(.), then followed
 * by a number showing the precision of the formatted value.
 * e.g. {.3}, {.17}, ...
 *
 * <p>
 * <output-format> are one of the following characters:
 *     d    -    The number will be formatted in dec.
 *     o    -    The number will be formatted in oct.
 *     x    -    The number will be formatted in hex.
 *     e    -    The number will be formatted in scientific format.
 * e.g. {x}, {o}, {e}
 *
 * <p>
 * <alignment> must start with a colon(:), then followed by alignment
 * settings in (-)?<number>(|<char>)? format. If the short dash(-) was
 * specified, the alignment direction was set to left, otherwise right.
 * The <number> is showing the minimal room of the formatted value.
 * If the <char> was specified, the unfilled room will be formatted
 * to <char>, otherwise the space char.
 * e.g. {:100|=} means right aligned to width 100, fill the rest with '='
 * e.g. {:-10} means left aligned to width 10, fill the rest with ' ' (space char)
